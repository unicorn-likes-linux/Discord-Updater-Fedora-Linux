# Discord-Updater-Fedora-Linux
A script that automates updating Discord on Fedora.

The flatpack version of Discord struggled to detect games on my devices so I downloaded it manually. Unfortunately, manual download requires you to update manually whenever there's a new version. A wrote a script to make this process quicker.
